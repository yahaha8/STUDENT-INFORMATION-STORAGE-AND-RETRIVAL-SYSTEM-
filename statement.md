###PROBLEM STATEMENT
Managing student information manually becomes confusing because the details are scattered and not organized properly.
There is no simple way to store the data or check it later without searching through multiple pages.
So, I wanted to make a very basic system where I can add student details and also search them whenever needed.


###SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
a]The project focuses on creating a small menu-based Python program that allows the user to:
b]Add student data
c]Store it safely in a text file
d]Fetch and display the stored data when required
e]It does not use databases or advanced storage — everything is beginner-level and meant for simple file handling practice.
f]The project is limited to basic operations but can be expanded in the future.


###TARGET USERS
a]Students who want to maintain their own records
b]Teachers who want a small tool to store student information
c]Beginners learning Python basics like loops, dictionaries, and file handling
d]Anyone who needs a lightweight and simple information storage system


HIGH LEVEL FEATURES
a]Text-file based storage system
b]Add multiple student records at once
c]Search for students by name
d]Menu-driven interface that is easy to understand
e]Uses dictionary structure to organize student details
f]Beginner-friendly and easy to modify later
